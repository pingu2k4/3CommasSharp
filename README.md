# 3CommasSharp

This is a C# API for 3Commas. It isn't fully featured, but may be a good base to expand upon.
Official docs are lacking, so doesn't make sense to attempt to work on stuff for now that I don't really need at this moment as doing so is a bit of a mine field not knowing exactly what values to provide or expect.
